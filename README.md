# Andreev Multi Interferometer

## Models 
- `infinite_chain.ipynb` model for an infinite closed system. Allows studying the band-structures, Josephson energies and so on.
- `finite_size_chain.ipynb` model for a finite-size, open, chain. Allows for studying transport properties and also non-periodic phase differences.
